    <h2>Description :</h2>
    <p>
        The beauty of a creamy pumpkin soup (and this classic pumpkin soup recipe in particular) is that it’s so versatile and forgiving. It’s one of the easiest meals to make with just a handful of ingredients, and it’s almost impossible to mess up. We love easy soup recipes, and know our community of home cooks do too.

    <h2>Ingreedient :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pumpkin</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        While it can be tempting to skip the coriander, cumin and nutmeg, they really do bring warmth and flavour to this pumpkin soup. If you haven't matched pumpkin and nutmeg in a recipe before, it really is a revelation!
        <li>Onion and leek</li>
        <li>Cream</li>
        <li>Potato</li>
    </ul>

                Heat oil in a large saucepan over low heat, add onion and leek and cook for 2-3 minutes, until softened but not coloured.
