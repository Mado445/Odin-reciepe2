    <h2> Description :</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Fried rice </strong> has long been a staple of Aussie takeaway dinners. And, while we might all have our favourite restaurant that makes Chinese fried rice just the way we like it, satisfying fried rice is a dish that's surprisingly easy to replicate at home. It's also a great way to use up any freshly cooked rice that's been leftover from the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
        We've been making this particular <strong>fried rice </strong> for more than 20 years, and it's the version we keep coming back to again and again. Why? It manages to pack in a lot of flavour for surprisingly little effort, and, if you follow our step-by-step tips, you really can create a DIY fried rice dish to rival your local takeaway joint.
